How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It's easy do see the mistakes comparing the two files with the diff command.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because I can see the changes I made as my development grows in time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You can learn to commit at the best time while you grows your understanding.
    Cons: It can be difficult until you learn the right time to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Maybe because Git is a more appropriate VCS for use with program development.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log
    git diff fileb filea

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It's easier to come back to the last working code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To develop my first Android App.
